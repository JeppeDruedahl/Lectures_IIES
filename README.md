# Analyzing Heterogeneous Agent Models in Sequence Space

*Mini-course taught at IIES in September 2023* 

## Lecturs 

Course plan in `IIES_Lectures.pdf`

* **Lecture 1**. Recap of consumption-saving and stationary equilibrium
* **Lecture 2**. Transitional dynamics in sequence space
* **Lecture 3**. Aggregate risk, linearized dynamics and analytical analysis 
* **Lecture 4**. Examples: Open-Economy HANK + HANK with search-and-matching (SAM)

## Lecturs 

1. Using the numerical methods in practice
2. In Python using my [GEModelTools](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/GEModelTools) package

See `Code_and_exercises`

## Misc

Greatly inspired and influenced by Auclert, Bard√≥czy, Rognlie, Straub:

* Their [SSJ tools](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian) 
* Their [nber-workshop-2023](https://github.com/shade-econ/nber-workshop-2023)
