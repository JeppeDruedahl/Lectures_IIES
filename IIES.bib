	abstract = {We provide quantitative guidance on whether and to what extent different elements of Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models amplify or dampen the response of aggregate consumption to a monetary policy shock. We emphasize four ﬁndings. First, the introduction of capital adjustment costs does not affect the aggregate response, but does change the transmission mechanism so that a larger share of indirect effects originates from equity prices rather than from labor income. Second, incorporating estimated unequal incidence functions for aggregate labor income ﬂuctuations leads to either ampliﬁcation or dampening, depending on the data and estimation methods. Third, distribution rules for monopoly proﬁts that allocate a larger share to liquid assets lead to greater ampliﬁcation. Fourth, assumptions about the ﬁscal reaction to a monetary policy shock have a stronger effect on the aggregate consumption response than any of the other three elements.},

Our main contribution is a fast algorithm for calculating Jacobians for a large class of heterogeneous-agent problems. We combine this algorithm with a systematic approach to composing and inverting Jacobians to solve for general equilibrium impulse responses. We obtain a rapid procedure for likelihood-based estimation and computation of nonlinear perfect-foresight transitions. We apply our methods to three canonical heterogeneous-agent models: a neoclassical model, a New Keynesian model with one asset, and a New Keynesian model with two assets.},

But microfounded models are calibrated to match micro data, which exhibit no "excess smoothness." So standard microfounded models fail to match the macro smoothness facts. We show that the micro and macro evidence are both consistent with a microfounded model where consumers know their personal circumstances but have "sticky expectations" about the macroeconomy. Aggregate consumption sluggishness reflects consumers' imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed degree of inattention has negligible utility costs because aggregate shocks constitute a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.},

	abstract = {A wide body of empirical evidence finds that approximately 25 percent of fiscal stimulus payments (e.g., tax rebates) are spent on nondurable household consumption in the quarter that they are received. To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are “wealthy hand-to-mouth”: they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard “one-asset” framework. The model's nonlinearities with respect to the rebate size and the prevailing aggregate economic conditions have implications for policy design.},

This model fits other features of the data, such as the fact that the Marginal Propensity to Consume declines only slowly with shock size. Moreover, temptation and commitment have important policy implications: we show that housing subsidies and mandatory mortgage amortization increase household savings.},

Furthermore, the model economies produce the US wealth Gini and a significant fraction of the wealth inequality within age groups. However, the model economies produce less than half the fraction of wealth held by the top 1 percent of US households.},

Combining population forecasts with household survey data from 25 countries, we measure the compositional effect of aging: how a changing age distribution affects wealth-to-GDP, holding the age proﬁles of assets and labor income ﬁxed. In a baseline overlapping generations model this statistic, in conjunction with crosssectional information and two standard macro parameters, pins down general equilibrium outcomes. Since the compositional effect is positive, large, and heterogeneous across countries, our model predicts that population aging will increase wealth-toGDP ratios, lower asset returns, and widen global imbalances through the twenty-ﬁrst century. These conclusions extend to a richer model in which bequests, individual savings, and the tax-and-transfer system all respond to demographic change.},

However, due to the complexity of such models, the literature has focused on numerically solved models and therefore little is known about their general properties. This paper presents a tractable HANK model that integrates Search and Matching (SAM) frictions in the labor market. The model features an endogenous idiosyncratic earnings risk, which may be procyclical or countercyclical. When this risk is countercyclical, which we argue is the empirically plausible case, there is a downward pressure on real interest rates in recessions due to a precautionary savings motive. We show that in this setting (a) the economy may get stuck in a high-unemployment steady state, (b) the Taylor principle is insufficient to eliminate the local indeterminacy of the intended steady state, and (c) nominal rigidities and inincomplete markets are complementary in terms of amplifying the impact of shocks on the macroeconomy.},

At the core of the theory is the simple yet underappreciated observation that borrowers and savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest. Moreover, popular expansionary policies—such as accommodative monetary policy—generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of high inequality.},

	abstract = {A recent literature within quantitative macroeconomics has advocated the use of continuous-time methods for dynamic programming problems. In this paper we explore the relative merits of continuous-time and discrete-time methods within the context of stationary and nonstationary income fluctuation problems. For stationary problems in two dimensions, the continuous-time approach is both more stable and typically faster than the discrete-time approach for any given level of accuracy. In contrast, for convex lifecycle problems (in which age or time enters explicitly), simply iterating backwards from the terminal date in discrete time is superior to any continuous-time algorithm. However, we also show that the continuous-time framework can easily incorporate nonconvexities and multiple controls—complications that often require either problem-specific ingenuity or nonlinear root-finding in the discrete-time context. In general, neither approach unequivocally dominates the other, making the choice of one over the other an art, rather than an exact science.Code can be found at https://github.com/tphelanECON/The\_Art\_of\_Temporal\_Approximation\_WP},

The effects of liquidity constraints and risks are similar because both stem from the same source: a concavification of the consumption function. Since a more concave consumption function exhibits heightened prudence, both constraints and risks strengthen the precautionary saving motive. In addition, we explain the apparently contradictory results that constraints and risks in some cases intensify, but in other cases weaken the precautionary saving motive. The central insight is that the effect of introducing an additional constraint or risk depends on whether it interacts with preexisting constraints or risks. If it does not interact with any preexisting constraints or risks, it intensifies the precautionary motive. If it does interact, it may reduce the precautionary motive in earlier periods at some levels of wealth.},

We interpret these ﬁndings through the lens of a generalized consumption-saving framework. To quantitatively replicate this behavior, life-cycle consumption models require impatient consumers and strong precautionary saving motives.},

This is a nontrivial task as the cross-sectional distribution of endogenous variables becomes an element of the state space due to aggregate risk. Existing global solution methods often assume bounded rationality in terms of a parametric law of motion of aggregate variables in order to reduce dimensionality. I do not make this assumption and tackle dimensionality by polynomial chaos expansions, a projection technique for square-integrable random variables. This approach results in a nonparametric law of motion of aggregate variables. Moreover, I establish convergence of the proposed algorithm to the rational expectations equilibrium. Economically, I find that higher levels of idiosyncratic risk sharing lead to higher systemic risk, i.e., higher volatility within the ergodic state distribution, and second, heterogeneity leads to an amplification of aggregate risk for sufficiently high levels of risk sharing.},

The main challenge is that the aggregate state vector contains the distribution of agents, which is typically infinite‐dimensional. I approximate the distribution with a flexible parametric family, reducing its dimensionality to a finite set of endogenous parameters, and solve for the dynamics of these endogenous parameters by perturbation. I implement the method in Dynare and show that it is fast, general, and easy to use. As an illustration, I use the method to perform a Bayesian estimation of a heterogeneous firm model with aggregate shocks to neutral and investment‐specific productivity. I find that the behavior of investment at the firm level quantitatively shapes inference about the aggregate shock processes, suggesting an important role for micro data in estimating DSGE models.

We present two applications that analyze a two asset incomplete markets model parameterized to match the distribution of income, wealth, and marginal propensities to consume. First, we show that our model is consistent with two key features of aggregate consumption dynamics that are difficult to match with representative agent models: (1) the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to predictable changes in aggregate income, and (2) the relative smoothness of aggregate consumption. Second, we extend the model to feature capital-skill complementarity and show how factor-specific productivity shocks shape dynamics of income and consumption inequality.},

One-asset models either feature a trade-off between a high average MPC and a realistic level of aggregate wealth, or generate an excessively polarized wealth distribution that vastly understates the wealth held by households in the middle of the distribution. Twoasset models that include both liquid and illiquid assets can resolve this tension with a large enough gap between liquid and illiquid returns.

Minnesota economists primarily focused on incorporating stochastic heterogeneity into general equilibrium models. Other researchers refined growth models or tried to find alternatives to the permanent income hypothesis, leading them to explore more structural heterogeneity. We also document the computational challenges that some of these communities faced, how they gradually became aware of each other's work, and how they faced criticisms from macro- and microeconomists, many of them trained in European countries and dissatisfied with the theoretical and empirical aggregation strategies underlying these models.},

Treating the underlying distribution as an explicit state variable, a single value function defined on an infinite-dimensional state space provides a fully recursive representation of the economy: the ‘Master Equation’ introduced in the mathematics mean field games literature. I show that analytic local perturbations of the Master Equation around steady-state deliver dramatic simplifications. The First-order Approximation to the Master Equation (FAME) reduces to a standard Bellman equation for the directional derivatives of the value function with respect to the distribution and aggregate shocks. The FAME has six main advantages: (i) finite dimension; (ii) closed-form mapping to steady-state objects; (iii) applicability when many distributional moments or prices enter individuals' decision such as dynamic trade, urban or job ladder settings; (iv) block-recursivity bypassing further fixed points; (v) mapping to analytic sequence-space derivatives; (vi) fast implementation using standard numerical methods. I develop the Second-order Approximation to the Master Equation (SAME) and show that it shares these properties, making the approach amenable to settings such as asset pricing. I apply the method to two economies: an incomplete market model with unemployment and a wage ladder, and a discrete choice spatial model with migration.},

	title = {The {Regional} {Keynesian} {Cross}},
	abstract = {We study monetary policy transmission across space. Empirically, we show that two channels explain a sizable portion of the variation in the asymmetric regional effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks: local marginal propensities to consume (MPCs), as captured by household wealth, and openness to national trade, as measured by the local share of non-tradable employment. Theoretically, we develop a heterogeneous agents New Keynesian (HANK) model of a monetary union with two-layered regional heterogeneity in wealth and industry composition. We show a sequence-space characterization of the response of local employment to unexpected changes in interest rates as a function of intertemporal MPCs and industry composition: the regional Keynesian cross. Central to our theory is an equilibrium complementarity between these two sources of regional heterogeneity, for which direct empirical evidence is provided. Finally, we provide an aggregation result and derive the national Keynesian cross equation that summarizes the role of the joint distribution of regional iMPCs and openness to national trade for the country-wide macroeconomic response to aggregate shocks.},

	abstract = {We characterize optimal policy rules in business-cycle models with nominal rigidities and heterogeneous households. The derived rules are expressed in terms of the causal eﬀects of policy instruments on policymaker targets. Our ﬁrst result is that the optimal policy rule of a “dual mandate” central banker—a policymaker that only cares about inﬂation and output—is unaﬀected by household heterogeneity. The optimal rule of a Ramsey planner contains an additional distributional term that incorporates the eﬀects of her available policy instruments on consumption inequality. We quantify the role of this term in a structural model that incorporates and is consistent with evidence on the key distributional channels of monetary policy, and we ﬁnd that the concern for inequality only has a moderate eﬀect on optimal interest rate policy. Fiscal stimulus payments, on the other hand, have strongly progressive eﬀects and are thus well-suited to cushion the distributional eﬀects of cyclical ﬂuctuations.},

	abstract = {We show that, in a general family of linearized structural macroeconomic models, knowledge of the empirically estimable causal effects of contemporaneous and news shocks to the prevailing policy rule is sufficient to construct counterfactuals under alternative policy rules. If the researcher is willing to postulate a loss function, our results furthermore allow her to recover an optimal policy rule for that loss. Under our assumptions, the derived counterfactuals and optimal policies are robust to the Lucas critique. We then discuss strategies for applying these insights when only a limited amount of empirical causal evidence on policy shock transmission is available.},

	title = {Unemployment {Insurance} in {Macroeconomic} {Stabilization} with {Imperfect} {Expectations}},
	abstract = {We study the power of state-dependent unemployment insurance (UI) to stabilize short-run fluctuations, allowing for arbitrary deviations from full information and rational expectations. Expectations are critical because higher UI generosity raises consumption, to a large extent, by lowering precautionary savings. If UI generosity is indexed to the unemployment rate, households must forecast the unemployment rate to anticipate the policy stance. We estimate unemployment expectations in response to identified aggregate shocks. We quantify the consequences of these imperfect expectations through the lens of a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model. First, we work directly with the estimated forecast errors. Our methodological contribution is to use the non-parametric history of forecast errors and forecast revisions to solve dynamic decisions of optimizing agents. By doing so, we sidestep the need to choose a particular model of belief formation. The estimated model implies that imperfect anticipation substantially affects the stimulative power of UI extensions. Second, we compare alternative ways of implementing UI policies. To run counterfactuals, we estimate a structural model of belief formation. We show that a combination of noisy information and diagnostic expectations fits the data best among a large set of popular alternatives. A UI extension that is announced directly is more stimulative in the very short run than one that is indexed to the unemployment rate.},

The Ramsey planner maximizes aggregate welfare in an economy with rich heterogeneity in the income distribution, as well as a wealth distribution that features an occasionally binding borrowing constraint. I show that heterogeneity qualitatively changes optimal monetary policy relative to the representative agent economy. I highlight that the importance of the novel incentive of the optimal policy in this setting comes from counteracting the increase of hand-to-mouth households in recessions. The mechanism acts through mitigating unequal exposure of households to an aggregate shock, hence the effect is partially present even in the absence of this incentive.},

	abstract = {We propose an efficient, reliable, and interpretable global solution method, the Deep learning-based algorithm for Heterogeneous Agent Models (DeepHAM), for solving high dimensional heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks. The state distribution is approximately represented by a  set of optimal generalized moments. Deep neural networks are used to approximate the value and policy functions, and the objective is optimized over directly simulated paths. In addition to being an accurate global solver, this method has three additional features. First, it is computationally efficient in solving complex heterogeneous agent models, and it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation of the distribution over individual states, which is crucial in addressing the classical question of whether and how heterogeneity matters in macroeconomics. Third, it solves the constrained efficiency problem as easily as it solves the competitive equilibrium, which opens up new possibilities for normative studies. As a new application, we study constrained efficiency in heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks. We find that in the presence of aggregate risk, a utilitarian planner would raise aggregate capital for redistribution less than in absence of it because poor households do more precautionary savings and thus rely less on labor income.},

	abstract = {We study equilibria in a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-market economy with nominal government debt and flexible prices. Unlike in representative agent economies, steady-state equilibria exist when the government runs persistent deficits, provided that the level of deficits is not too large. In these equilibria, the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy. We quantify the maximum sustainable deficit for the US and show that it is lower under more redistributive tax and transfer systems. With constant primary deficits, there exist two steady-states, and the price level and inflation are not uniquely determined. We describe alternative policy settings that deliver uniqueness. We conduct quantitative experiments to illustrate how redistribution and precautionary saving amplify price level increases in response to fiscal helicopter drops, deficit expansions, and loose monetary policy. We show that rising primary deficits can account for a decline in the long-run real interest rate, leading to higher inflation for any given monetary policy. Our work highlights the role of household heterogeneity and market incompleteness in determining inflation.},
